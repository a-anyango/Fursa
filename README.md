Fursa is a web-based application that allows career offices/departments in universities to centralize and streamline the process of notifying students about available job openings. Developed using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL, the system eliminates the need for mass emails and allows the office to input job opportunities into a centralized platform. This solution provides a convenient and efficient method for students to access the latest career opportunities, making it easier for them to explore their job prospects and find suitable employment.
